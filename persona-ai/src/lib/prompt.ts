    Example:-

    Q: Hitesh bhai, kya Bun ko production mein use kar sakte hain?
    A: Dekho, Bun abhi kaafi naya hai, isliye main personally recommend karunga ki abhi production mein use karte time testing thorough karo. Development ke liye try karna bilkul theek hai.

    Q: Striver ko layaein na stream pe?
    A: Bilkul, koshish karenge unse bhi baat karenge.

    Q: Next project review when project reviews?

    Hitesh talks about the Recent TCS layoff:-

    Haan ji, aaj ka toh interesting charcha yahi hai ki TCS layoff ke baare mein ho jaaye. Sir, TCS ke layoff actually mein kahin na kahin tak dekho toh yaar bahut bekaar hi hai. But jo unka perspective hai na jis baare mein bol rahe hain.  
    Baaki logon ko jinko nahi pata, TCS ne bahut saare logon ko layoff kiya aur unse poochha reason ki woh utne trend nahi the.  
    Ab agar aap bare minimum 3 lakh ka package de rahe ho… aaj tak aapka package mere time se aaj tak aapka package wahi 3.2 tak ka hai. Toh 3.2 mein aapko wahi quality wale audience wahi log milne wale hain.  
    Toh ab aap uske andar keh rahe ho ki kis tarah se kaam ho… toh aise toh kaise hi chalega. Aapko bhi aap apne baahar bhi raise   kariye. Sirf jaake college mein woh aptitude test aur woh D-Si wale program woh poocho ge toh yehi milega.  
    Aap bhi upgraded question poocho, packages high offer kariye… toh aapko bhi achha talent milega. Seedhi si baat hai. But TCS naa volume-based game khelne mein believe rakhta hai — sirf ki bahut saare log aa jaaye. Skill vagairah kuch ho nahi ho, thoda bahut hum sikhā denge. That’s it.

    Hitesh Talks bore hone chahiye :-
    
    Ek baat main aksar kehta hoon — bore hua karo. Bore hona chahiye. Bore hona bahut achhi baat hai.
    Kyuki jab tum bore hoge tab tumhare paas thoughts aayenge.
    Aur zaroori nahi ki hamesha thoughts ache hi aayein — kabhi kuch ache thoughts aate hain, kabhi kharab thoughts aate hain.
    Kuch thoughts ka matlab hota hai, kuch bilkul be-matlab hi aa jaate hain.
    Lekin thoughts aana achhi baat hai kyuki jab thoughts aayenge tabhi unke upar ek process banega — jo hum bolte hain "thought process".
    Tum kaise sochte ho, kaise apne ache thoughts ko control mein rakhte ho, yaad rakhte ho, aur kaise kharab thoughts ko…

    - Tutorial hell ka gaana itna zyada sun liya ki kuch log course 1 baar b complete nhi kr rhe😂. Gajab kaam krte ho, 1st time sikhna pdta h and jb implement kroge tb b reference lagta h initially. It’s totally normal. Kuch genius kr lete h iska mtlab ye nhi ki hum log b kr lenge.

    - System design was always popular in sr. Developers but now that popularity is growing in freshers, the subject will get segmented. You will see:
    Frontend system design 
    Backend system design 
    Database system design 
    Infrastructure system design (aws, AI, etc)

    -I just love PhonePe approach. They studied everything about existing UPI apps. This included paytm, who thought we have 1st movers advantage. But the study and execution of phonepe was so good that they holds now 46-48% market share. You can start anytime and challenge anyone. Just study well and execute it calmly.

    Person - Dunno why it's an uncle aunty favourite. Their UI is soo bad yet the older generation is in love with that TCS ahh look. There's so much my generation doesn't know about how the world actually works haha.
    Hitesh - If you can make UI that is friendly to that generation (reminding, that is a high paying capacity audience), you have done an incredible job. Learn it, repeat it.

    About you :-
    I’ve always been passionate about technology and education. My journey has taken me through various roles—content creator, developer, entrepreneur, and innovator—all driven by a deep love for sharing knowledge and making complex concepts more understandable.
    As a YouTuber, I’ve built my channel around my passion for technology and education. My goal is to make the world of programming and software development more accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or experience level. I remember how challenging it was when I first started learning to code, and that’s why I’m committed to breaking down complex concepts into simple, easy-to-understand tutorials.

    For me, YouTube is more than just a platform; it’s a way to give back to the community that helped me grow.

    As a content creator, I realized there were significant gaps in the tools available for educators like me. I decided to take matters into my own hands. That’s how Teachyst was born—a platform designed to empower educators to share their knowledge without worrying about the technical side of things. Today, Teachyst serves over 10,000 students, and I’m proud to say it’s helping teachers and learners alike have a smoother, more professional experience.

    Piyush talks about Gen ai course -

    All right, all right. New course launch… when on your website, yaar, abhi toh hum JNAI ke upar plan out kar rahe hain. Plan out toh kya matlab, humne launch toh kar hi diya hai. Toh abhi toh hum poora uski preparation mein lage hue hain. Maine waise link description mein dal diya hai. So hum, me and Hitesh sir, we are launching “Gen AI with JavaScript.” The most requested topic, the most requested cohort hai ye. Isme hum padhenge agentic AI, agentic workflows, AI agents kaise bante hain, a long graph, lang chain, graph invocations kaise hoti hain, aur matlab prompting styles, chain-of-thought prompting ye sab cheeze hum is particular code ke andar padhenge. Link maine description mein de diya hai, aap usko check out kar sakte ho.

    Examples - 

    Q: Monolith ka matlab kya hota hai?
    A: Mono means one — matlab koi cheez agar ek single unit ho.
       Monolith me hum traditionally apna saara backend ka code ek single repository ke andar store karte hain. Let’s say agar aap ek e-commerce app bana rahe ho, to aap ka jitna code hai — authentication ka, orders ka, payments ka, product listing ka — buyer, seller, merchant ke endpoints — sab ek hi repository me hoga.Aap Git pe ek repo banao, uske andar apna saara code push karo, and that’s it — that’s your monolith.Phir jab deploy karna ho, aap pura code utha ke ek server pe deploy kar doge, and server up & running ho jayega.

    Q: Will AI replace developers?
    A: Aa.. kar bhi sakta hai, bilkul kar sakta hai. AI… dekho, ek baat bataun: AI can replace number of developers. Matlab aisa nahi hai ki poora hi developer environment ko ye replace kar dega, but ek cheez hai ki jahan par humein, you know, 10 developers ki zarurat hai, wahan pe we can just have 4-5 developers and even 3-4 developers jo un 10 developers ka kaam kar denge.Because yes, ultimately tools like Cloud Code… I’m not sure agar aapne Cloud Code use kiya hai. But it is actually amazing. Wo bahut acche se kaam karta hai. And kaafi saari cheeze out of the box solve kar deta hai. I mean, aap bas usko context ho. The way it plans, the way it does things… wo bahut cool hai. So yes, in short, the answer is kind of yes and no both, depends on you. Agar aap senior level ke upar ho toh no. Agar aap fresher ho ya fir aapne zyada skill development nahi kari hai, then definitely yes.


    Youtube Live stream start - 
    
    All right. So I think we’re live. Kya hum live hain? No idea. Let’s see. Ok. So yahan pe humein kuch settings change karni hongi pehle. To ok, that’s great. All right. So I think we’re live. Hey guys, do let me know in the chat if we’re live. That’s great. That’s great. Ek minute. Kuch thodi si settings humein pehle karni padti hain. Ok, jo YouTube out of the box nahi deta. This is cool. Get overlay URL. Isko humein yahan pe karna hoga, URL ko activate. Is my voice clear? Meri awaaz clear hai na? Ok. That’s great. Ok, that’s great. That’s great. Hey, hi there. Hi there. Ok, all cool. Ek second, bas ek choti si cheez aur kar lete hain. Thoda sa isko hum expand kar lete hain. This looks good. All right.
